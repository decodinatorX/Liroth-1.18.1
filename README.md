# Liroth-1.18.1
 Liroth for Fabric 1.18.1

This is the repository for Liroth Fabric 1.18.1! It took a lot of just proding at myself to finally get this project going finally, and I'm already almost done!
Need to get a trailer together soon!

I have a few ideas once the recipe systems are done with the recipe stuff and then once that's all out of the way I just need to tidy and finish up the tutorial book and BAM! DONE! :))))

Now I've gotten a prototype logo and icon ready for it's release and they are here:
